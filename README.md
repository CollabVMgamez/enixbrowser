# FUCKING COMPILE THIS SHIT

First. Get .NET 8.0 SDK. THEN WEBVIEW 2!!! YOU ARE A BITCH IF YOU COMPLAIN (webview 2 link https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2) Microsoft SPYWARE GOOD 

Then its easy. download source, extract it. go to the folder where extracted. dotnet build, then dotnet run. SIMPLE! YOU HAVE IT!

# FUCKING MODIFY THE LOGO

if you hate it? it sucks? FUCK YOU. But ok i know it looks ass. Open in VS Code or Notepad Enixbrowser.csproj, remove the <ApplicationIcon>Assets\sotuff.ico</ApplicationIcon> thing or replace it with something else and DONE!


# FUCKING MODIFY THE CODE
